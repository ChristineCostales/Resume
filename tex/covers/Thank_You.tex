\opening{Dear Ms. LastName:} 


	
I would like to express my sincere thanks for giving me the privilege of being interviewed 
for the current position of Application Developer within your company.  Listening to the 
points you have made and from what I read about Publicis Groupe S.A., I am particularly 
impressed with the Companyâ€™s performance and its strong commitment to innovation, creativity, 
new technologies implementation and strive for success. I recognize the importance of the 
Application Developer position and I strongly believe that, given the opportunity, I will be 
challenged to perform to my very best in this work environment.

I am confident that my academic training, my computer skills, my desire to learn and my hunger 
for continuous personal improvement utilized in servicing your Company will meet and, I promise, 
exceed your expectations.   

Please, permit me to express my deepest appreciation once more.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.  In the meantime, please contact me if I can provide more information or answer any additional questions.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
